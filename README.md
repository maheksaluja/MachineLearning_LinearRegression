# MachineLearning_LinearRegression
Following operations are done on given dataset:
  1. Plot the scatter plot and box plot of given data set for pre-analysis of data
  2. Computed mean, median, range, first, third quartile and interquartile range.
  3. Fit the simple linear regression model for each predictor and doen some analysis.
  4. Fit the model using all predictor and make comments on null hypothesis.
  5. Try to find out non-linear association between any predictor.
  6. Trying to find out evidence of interaction of predictor with response.
  7. Train the regression with all possible interaction and non-linear association
  8. Implemented KNN regression and done some analysis.
